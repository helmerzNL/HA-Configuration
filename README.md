## Background

I noticed a screenshot from a colleague showing his HA dashboard in which wrote a nice hack to give him some insights of the status of the nearby public charging poles. So I asked him to share some code with me, which he did. 

This is the result my adoption of his code to my HA instance. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/helmerzNL/HA-Configuration/tree/main/Packages/house/car). Feel free to re-use it.


## Charging Pole
When you download the code, please notice that you need to change the [resource](./Packages/house/car/laadpaal_rest.yaml) parameter. Visit [Nextcharge.app](https://nextcharge.app/) and look for the charging pole you would like to add.

![Look up Charging Pole](./images/laadpaal_howto_01.png)

Now, press (F12, to open the Developer Tools) and click the url to open it in a new tab. 

![Click URL](./images/laadpaal_howto_02.png)

Copy this url and paste it in the *resource* field in the [laadpaal_rest.yaml](./Packages/house/car/laadpaal_rest.yaml) file.

Now restart Home Assistant and create a card showing the created sensors.

## Sonos Notification
Iâ€™ve been using Sonos speakers in my house quiet some time. In my early HA days I used Node-red for those notifications. But I found the time to recreate them in native HA automations. [Here](/Packages/notification/sonos_speaker_script_v6.yaml) you can find the latest iteration of the script. 

You can use the script by using my Automation example, which you can find [here](/Packages/_templates/sonos_notification_example_automation.yaml). Customize the defined variables any way you like, they will be passed on (and used) in the script.

**Example**
I've included an example [here](Packages/notification/sonos_service_example.yaml) that will give you an example of a service you could include in your own automations.


*Note: I've included a few conditional actions that are used in combination with a Sonos soundbar and with a LG TV, which will show a toast message if the message has not priority. If you don't have a soundbar you can remove those actions.* 

When u have an Apple TV (or other media player) using the Sonos speaker for audio output, you will also need the [Helper](/Packages/notification/sonos_speaker_helper.yaml). If you don't have this setup (and you don't use one of the Sonos soundbars), you can remove the part in the script that checks (and sets) the input_boolean (marked with *##THIS PART IS ONLY REQUIRED IF YOU HAVE A SONOS SOUNDBAR AND YOU USE IT FOR TV/XBOX/MEDIAPLAYER AUDIO*).

## Integrate iOS Alarm with Home Assistant
Would it be nice if you could just configure the alarm on your iPhone and when it is time to go to bed, that time automatically syncs to your HA instance. And then in the morning, when your iPhone alarm goes off, your Sonos speaker starts playing music and your Philips HUE lights slowly turns on (and/or any other device you want to activate when you wake up).

On the official [HA Community forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sync-next-ios16-alarm-clock-in-ha-with-shortcuts-and-companion-app/494726/62) I've found a way (with the help of some Apple Shortcuts) to achieve this. 

The configuration consists of two Shortcuts :

- [Configure HA Alarm](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ee37cd7e90904b38a467a723279665a9) - Configures the Boolean in HA when 'Sleep mode' is turned on. 
- [Turn HA Alarm Off](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ca72d93ecfc7405cab005059c6f0c97c) - Turns Off the Sonos/HUE when you turn off the iOS Alarm (when it sounds)

And a few automations and helpers, which you can find [here](/Packages/house/rooms/bedroom)

Please make sure you edit the Shortcuts to fit your needs:
- entity_id -> use your own input_boolean here, in the shortcut above it is set to input_datetime.ios_alarm (and in my scripts I use input_boolean.wekker_iphone)
- Label -> Edit the label where the Shortcut is looking for, in my example I use *Wekker*


Please let me know if you have any questions.
