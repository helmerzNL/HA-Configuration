I noticed a screenshot from a colleague showing his HA dashboard in which wrote a nice hack to give him some insights of the status of the nearby public charging poles. So I asked him to share some code with me, which he did. 

This is the result my adoption of his code to my HA instance. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/helmerzNL/HA-Configuration/tree/main/Packages/house/car). Feel free to re-use it.
