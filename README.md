## Background

I noticed a screenshot from a colleague showing his HA dashboard in which wrote a nice hack to give him some insights of the status of the nearby public charging poles. So I asked him to share some code with me, which he did. 

This is the result my adoption of his code to my HA instance. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/helmerzNL/HA-Configuration/tree/main/Packages/house/car). Feel free to re-use it.


## Charging Pole
When you download the code, please notice that you need to change the [resource](./Packages/house/car/laadpaal_rest.yaml) parameter. Visit [Nextcharge.app](https://nextcharge.app/) and look for the charging pole you would like to add.

![Look up Charging Pole](./images/laadpaal_howto_01.png)

Now, press (F12, to open the Developer Tools) and click the url to open it in a new tab. 

![Click URL](./images/laadpaal_howto_02.png)

Copy this url and paste it in the *resource* field in the [laadpaal_rest.yaml](./Packages/house/car/laadpaal_rest.yaml) file.

Now restart Home Assistant and create a card showing the created sensors.

## Sonos Notification
Iâ€™ve been using Sonos speakers in my house quiet some time. In my early HA days I used Node-red for those notifications. But I found the time to recreate them in native HA automations. [Here](/Packages/notification/sonos_speaker_script.yaml) you can find the first version of the script. 

You can use the script by using my Automation example, which you can find [here](/Packages/_templates/sonos_notification_example_automation.yaml). Customize the defined variables any way you like, they will be passed on (and used) in the script.

**Example**
I've included an example [here](Packages/notification/sonos_service_example.yaml) that will give you an example of a service you could include in your own automations.


*Note: I've included a few conditional actions that are used in combination with a Sonos soundbar and with a LG TV, which will show a toast message if the message has not priority. If you don't have a soundbar you can remove those actions.* 

When u have an Apple TV (or other media player) using the Sonos speaker for audio output, you will also need the [Helper](/Packages/notification/sonos_speaker_helper.yaml). If you don't have this setup (and you don't use one of the Sonos soundbars), you can remove the part in the script that checks (and sets) the input_boolean (marked with *##THIS PART IS ONLY REQUIRED IF YOU HAVE A SONOS SOUNDBAR AND YOU USE IT FOR TV/XBOX/MEDIAPLAYER AUDIO*).
